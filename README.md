Run this command to project lidar on camera
        python project_lidar_to_camera.py

Next steps: 
1. Colorize by distance values
2. Debugging the code with the approximate Transformation matrix to make sure the data points look reasonable (\130.75.51.36\mapathon_upload\data_raw\IKG_VAN\CALIBRATION\from_LT_before/Cams_on_PCS_mat.csv)
3. Camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration
